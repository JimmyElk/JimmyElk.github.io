    <p>A Progressive Web Application (PWA) is a type of application software delivered through the web, built using
        common web technologies including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is intended to work on any platform that uses a
        standards-compliant browser.</p>

    <p>Key characteristics of PWAs include:</p>

    <ul>

        <li>Progressive: Works for every user, regardless of browser choice.</li>

        <li>Responsive: Fits any form factor, desktop, mobile, tablet, or whatever is next.</li>

        <li>Connectivity independent: Enhanced with service workers to work offline or on low-quality networks.</li>

        <li>App-like: Feels like an app to the user with app-style interactions and navigation.</li>

        <li>Safe: Served via HTTPS to prevent snooping and to ensure content hasn't been tampered with.</li>

        <li>Discoverable: Can be identified as an "application" by search engines.</li>

        <li>Re-engageable: Make re-engagement easy through features like push notifications.</li>

    </ul>
