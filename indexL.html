            <h2>Flutter</h2>

            <p>Flutter is Google's UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop
                from a single codebase.</p>


            <h3>Pros:</h3>

            <ul>

                <li> High performance and smooth animations due to its use of the Dart language and Skia
                    graphics
                    engine.</li>

                <li> Hot reload feature for quick development iterations.</li>

                <li> Rich set of customizable widgets for building beautiful interfaces.</li>

            </ul>


            <h3>Cons:</h3>

            <ul>

                <li> Requires learning the Dart programming language.</li>

                <li> Large app size compared to some other frameworks.</li>

                <li> Relatively new compared to other frameworks, so community support may not be as extensive.
                </li>

            <h2>React Native</h2>

            <p>React Native is a framework developed by Facebook for building mobile applications using React and
                JavaScript.</p>


            <h3>Pros:</h3>

            <ul>

                <li> Allows for building cross-platform applications with a single codebase.</li>

                <li> Reuse of components and logic between web and mobile applications.</li>

                <li> Strong community support and a large ecosystem of third-party libraries.</li>

            </ul>


            <h3>Cons:</h3>

            <ul>

                <li> May require bridging to native code for accessing device-specific features.</li>

                <li> Performance may not be as fast as native applications, especially for complex animations.
                </li>

                <li> Dependency on Facebook and potential for changes in the framework over time.</li>
